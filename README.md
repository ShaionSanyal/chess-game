# chess-game
This project is a real-time multiplayer chess game built using Node.js for the backend, Socket.IO for real-time communication, and MongoDB for persistent data storage. It enables users to play chess against each other online with smooth, interactive gameplay and real-time updates.

Key features include:

Real-Time Gameplay: Leveraging Socket.IO, players receive instant updates on moves, ensuring a seamless and synchronous gaming experience.

User Authentication & Profiles: MongoDB stores user accounts, game histories, and player statistics securely.

Game State Persistence: Each gameâ€™s state is saved in MongoDB, allowing players to resume interrupted games or review past matches.

Matchmaking System: Players can find and join available games or challenge friends directly.

Move Validation: Server-side logic enforces chess rules to validate moves, preventing cheating or illegal plays.

Built with scalability in mind, this project showcases the power of modern web technologies to create engaging multiplayer experiences.
